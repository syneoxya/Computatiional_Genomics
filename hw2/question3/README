This directory contains several read sets that are the starting point for the
challenge.  The reads were generated by taking a portion of an organism's
reference sequence and inserting a secret message into the genome.
Your challenge is to identify the inserted sequence and decode the message.

You can use the included dna-decode.py script to decode the message.  It uses
the algorithm defined in George M. Church, Yuan Gao, and Sriram Kosuri.

The types of reads in each FASTQ (.fq) file are described in detail below.

frag180.1.fq   Read 1 of Illumina 2x100 reads from 180 +/- 20 bp fragments
frag180.2.fq   Read 2 of Illumina 2x100 reads from 180 +/- 20 bp fragments
jump2k.1.fq    Read 1 of Illumina 2x50  reads from 2000 +/- 200 bp fragments
jump2k.2.fq    Read 2 of Illumina 2x50  reads from 2000 +/- 200 bp fragments
